    "The purpose of this checkpoint notebook is to apply the methods we used in `04_Characterizing_Demand_Beginner.ipynb` to your cohort by utilizing a measure of your choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the checkpoint notebooks for `02_Creating_a_cohort.ipynb`, we asked you to create and save your cohort as an SQL table. You will be utilizing the cohort you created as part of this checkpoint notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "At each checkpoint, you will be replacing the `___` with the appropriate variable, function or R code snippet. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to attempt the checkpoints on your own. Having said that, hints and suggested solutions are provided and these can be accessed by utilizing the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints: `check_#.hint()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions: `check_#.solution()` – your solutions may vary based on how you define your cohort. We have shared our suggested solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, # refers to the checkpoint number. For example: we can access the hint and solution for Checkpoint 2 using: `check_2.hint()` and `check_2.solution()`, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This checkpoint notebook has been created by keeping a cohort of apprenticeship graduates in mind. We encourage you to reach out to your team facilitator to learn more about the methods you can use to characterize demand if your cohort is defined differently, such as by apprenticeship starters. Also, the code for accessing hints and solutions is currently commented out – in order for the cells to run, you will need to uncomment them first. "
