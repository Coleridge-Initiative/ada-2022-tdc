    "The purpose of this checkpoint notebook is to apply the methods you saw in `05_Presentation_Prep.ipynb` to a potential visualization of your cohort. Here, we will produce an image depicting your cohort's wages by an aggregated race variable and confirm that the final visual will pass export review.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the checkpoint notebooks `02_Creating_a_cohort.ipynb`, you were asked to create and save your cohort as an SQL table. You will be utilizing the cohort you created as part of this checkpoint notebook (or perhaps an updated cohort you have since created). \n",
    "\n",
    "At each checkpoint, you will be replacing the `___` with the appropriate variable, function or R code snippet. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to attempt the checkpoints on your own. Having said that, hints and suggested solutions are provided and these can be accessed by utilizing the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints: `check_#.hint()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions: `check_#.solution()` – your solutions may vary based on how you define your cohort. We have shared our suggested solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, # refers to the checkpoint number. For example: we can access the hint and solution for Checkpoint 2 using: `check_2.hint()` and `check_2.solution()`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This checkpoint notebook has been created by keeping a cohort of apprenticeship completers in mind. We encourage you to reach out to your team facilitator to learn more about the methods you can use if your cohort is defined differently, such as by apprenticeship starters. Also, the code for accessing hints and solutions is currently commented out – in order for the cells to run, you will need to uncomment them first. "

    "\n",
    "- **Each team will be able to export up to 10 figures/tables**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Every statistic for export must be based on at least 11 individuals and at least 3 employers (when using wage records)**\n",
    "     - Statistics that are based off of 0-10 individuals must be supressed\n",
    "     - Statistics that are based off of 0-2 employers must be supressed\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **All counts will need to be rounded**\n",
    "    - Counts below 1000 should be rounded to the nearest ten\n",
    "    - Counts greater than or equal to 1000 should be rounded to the nearest hundred\n",
    "    > For example, a count of 868 would be rounded to 870 and a count of 1868 would be rounded to 1900\n",
    "\n",
    "- **All reported wages will need to be rounded to the nearest hundred** \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **All reported averages will need to be rounded to the nearest hundredth** \n",
    "   \n",
    "- **All percentages and proportions need to be rounded**\n",
    "    - The same rounding rule that is applied to counts must be applied to both the numerator and denominator\n",
    "    - Percentages must then be rounded to the nearest percent\n",
    "    - Proportions must be rounded to the nearest hundredth\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exact percentiles can not be exported** \n",
    "    - Instead, for example, you may calculate a “fuzzy median”, by averaging the true 45th and 55th percentiles\n",
    "       - If you are calculating the fuzzy percentiles for wage, you will need to round to the nearest hundred after calculating the fuzzy percentile\n",
    "       - If you are calculating the fuzzy percentile for a number of individuals, you will need to round to the nearest 10 if the count is less than 1000 and to the nearest hundred if the count is greater than or equal to 1000\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Exact Maxima and Minima can not be exported**\n",
    "    - Suppress maximum and minimum values in general\n",
    "    - You may replace an exact maximum or minimum with a top-coded value or a fuzzy maximum or minimum value. For example: If the maximum value for earnings is 154,325, it could be top-coded as '100,000+'. And a fuzzy maximum value could be: \n",
    "    $$\\frac{95th\\ percentile\\ of\\ earnings + 154325}{2}$$\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "- **Complementary suppression**\n",
    "    - If your figures include totals or are dependent on a preceding or subsequent figures, you need to take into account complementary disclosure risks—that is, whether the figure totals or the separate figures when read together, might disclose information about less then 11 individuals in the data in a way that a single, simpler table would not. Team facilitators and export reviewers will work with you by offering guidance on implementing any necessary complementary suppression techniques"
