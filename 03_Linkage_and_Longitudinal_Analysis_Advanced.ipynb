    "Record linkage is an important component of any analysis, unless you have a fictitious perfectly curated dataset with no messiness or missing variables, but especially when linking administrative records. Unlike survey data that allows for perfectly selected variables with some potential for messiness, administrative data is tailored to adminisitrative purposes (and not academic). That means that we won't have all of the variables we ideally want, and it also means that the data can be messy (either missing responses or with variables that we may not quite understand or have at our disposal). While we may not directly address missing responses (more on indirectly addressing this in the inference lecture), we can do some things to enrich our data set by pulling in relevant information from other data sets. We will proceed to describe how to link TANF, UI Wages, and employer information to create a panel of individual records over time. We also describe some of the issues that arise when linking records of various sorts."

Now we would like to extend the information about the cohort's experiences by tracking the cohort's employment outcomes over time. This is one way in which we may begin to track employment 'success' over a period of time. We can do this by using the IN UI Wage data for a year out from the date of exit, for example. This means we can track a cohort over the span of 4 quarters (as in this notebook), or the number of quarters of interest for your own analysis.
