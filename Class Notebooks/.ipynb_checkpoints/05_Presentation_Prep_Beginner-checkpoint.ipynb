    "- **Each team will be able to export up to 10 figures/tables**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Every statistic for export should be based on at least 10 individuals and at least 3 employers**.\n",
    "     - Statistics that are based off of 0-9 individuals must be surpressed\n",
    "     - Statistics that are based off of 0-2 employers must be surpressed\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **All counts will need to be rounded**\n",
    "    - Counts below 1000 should be rounded to the nearest 10\n",
    "    - Counts greater than or equal to 1000 should be rounded to the nearest 100\n",
    "    > For example, a count of 868 would be rounded to 870 and a count of 1868 would be rounded to 1900\n",
    "\n",
    "- **All reported wages will need to be rounded to the nearest hundred** \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **All reported averages will need to be rounded to the nearest hundredth** \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "- **All percentages and proportions need to be rounded**\n",
    "    - The same rounding rule that is applied to counts must be applied to both the numerator and denominator\n",
    "    - Percentages must then be rounded to the nearest percent\n",
    "    - Proportions must be rounded to the nearest hundredth\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exact percentiles can not be exported** \n",
    "    - Instead, for example, you may calculate a “fuzzy median”, by averaging the true 45th and 55th percentiles\n",
    "       > If you are calculating the fuzzy percentiles for wage, you will need to round to the nearest hundred after calculating the fuzzy percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "       > If you are calculating the fuzzy percentile for a number of individuals, you will need to round to the nearest 10 if the count is less than 1000 and to the nearest hundred if the count is greater than or equal to 1000.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Exact Maxima and Minima can not be exported**\n",
    "    - Suppress maximum and minimum values in general. \n",
    "    - You may replace an exact maximum or minimum with a top-coded value or a fuzzy maximum or minimum value. For example: If the maximum value for earnings is 154,325, it could be top-coded as '100,000+'. And a fuzzy maximum value could be: \n",
    "    $$\\frac{95th\\ percentile\\ of\\ earnings + 154325}{2}$$\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "- **Complementary suppression**\n",
    "    - If your figures include totals or are dependent on a preceding or subsequent figures, you need to take into account complementary disclosure risks—that is, whether the figure totals or the separate figures when read together, might disclose information about less then 10 individuals in the data in a way that a single, simpler table would not. Team facilitators and export reviewers will work with you by offering guidance on implementing any necessary complementary suppression techniques.\n"
