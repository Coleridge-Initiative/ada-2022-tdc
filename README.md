# Applied Data Analytics Program - 2022 TDC Class

There was a 2022 Applied Data Analytics training program sponsored by the TANF Data Collaborative focused on supporting TANF recipients. Participants worked in teams using confidential TANF and workforce data to study the employment pathways of TANF recipients and to develop measures of the jobs they get, the jobs they keep, and their success in moving up in the labor market. Furthermore, participants worked on understanding the demand side of the labor market and how to use machine learning to characterize the firms that hire TANF recipients and their contribution to labor market success. The program provided instruction on using big data tools including SQL and R. Participants received training on core data concepts such as record linkage, data visualization, and information quality.
